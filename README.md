# Koodihaaste 2022 / Ruokarähinä

This project was an entry to the [2022 coding challenge by Solidabis](https://koodihaaste.solidabis.com/).

The purpose of this project is to show some basic React SPA functionality with API calls.

The task was to carry out a food fight themed battle, where foods fight each other with different stats. For the implementation of the task, nutritional contents of different foods were supposed to be retrieved and some statistics should be implemented based on which the foods would fight each other. The technologies used in the implementation were free to choose.

The application must have / has the following functions:

- Search of various nutritional contents from an external source ([Fineli API](https://fineli.fi/fineli/en/ohje/19))
- Converting nutritional contents into character categories
- Logic implementation for a duel between two food figures
- Presentation of the results on the Frontend

The project was originally created using React, Node.js, Express and deployed on Heroku.
After Heroku limited their services, the project has been migrated to use Next.js and is now deployed on Vercel.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Live deployment on Vercel
